Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation among male/female population? 

Review 

No separate dose/dosing regimen is recommended in any patient  

based on sex. 

With increasing semaglutide exposure, a larger HbA1c change from baseline was seen in subjects with  

higher baseline HbA1c, and in subjects with shorter diabetes duration. The exposure-response relationship  

for HbA1c was similar in males and females (9, 86)

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in various body weights/BMI? 

Review 

A dose-response relationship with an ED50 value of approximately 15 mg was observed for  

change in body weight after 26 weeks of treatment with oral semaglutide. The steepest part of the curve  

ranged up to 20 mg, after which the effects started to plateau (31) 

Patients with body weights  

less than 70 kg had approximately twice the exposure of patients with body weight less than 110 kg.  

After considering the large variability in PK and shape of the exposure-response curve, dose-adjustment  

for weight is not necessary (66) 

Label 

The exposure of  

semaglutide decreases with an increase in body weight. However, RYBELSUS doses of 7 mg and 14 mg  

provide adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 40-188 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. (13) 

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation among different races? 

Review 

Race and ethnicity do not appear to affect the PK of oral Semaglutide and SNAC among Japanese and Caucasian subjects (pg 40,41).

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in renal dysfunction? 

 

Review 

Semaglutide exposure (SNAC also) did not exhibit any consistent patterns of increase or decrease with increasing renal  

Impairment evaluated in a multi-center, open-label,  

multiple-dose, parallel group study (Trial 4079) in which systemic exposure of semaglutide in subjects  

with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease (ESRD) was compared with  

that in subjects with normal renal function following a 10 day dosing regimen of oral semaglutide â€“ 5 mg  

for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days. (pg 22, 34,37). 

Although exposure of SNAC metabolites increased with  

increasing degree of renal impairment, amounting up to 26-fold increase in metabolite E1246 exposure,  

this does not seem to pose any safety concern considering the safety margin established with non-clinical  

studies (37)

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in hepatic dysfunction? 

Review 

Following 10 days of once daily dosing of oral semaglutide, the exposure of semaglutide (AUC and Cmax)  

were similar across the 4 hepatic function groups, indicating that semaglutide exposure is not affected by  

the degree of hepatic function conducted an open-label, multiple dose, parallel group trial to investigate the PK properties  

of semaglutide and SNAC in subjects with impaired hepatic function to assess whether there was a need  

to adjust the dose of oral semaglutide in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with  

normal hepatic function (36, ) 

Following 10 days of once daily dosing of oral semaglutide in the abovementioned clinical trial, the exposure of SNAC (AUC and Cmax)  

increased with a decrease in hepatic function (36) 

Label

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in other body organs? 

Review 

Following 10 days of once daily dosing of oral semaglutide (and SNAC), there was no statistically significant  

difference in exposure of semaglutide between subjects with and  

without upper GI disease, however the exposure of semaglutide appeared to be slightly higher in subjects  

with upper GI disease compared to subjects without upper GI disease evaluated through an open-label, multiple doses, parallel group trial to investigate the PK, safety  

and tolerability of semaglutide and SNAC in T2DM subjects with upper GI disease compared to subjects  

without upper GI disease (39, 40) 

Label 

The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation receiving RYBELSUS 7 mg (4%) and RYBELSUS 14 mg (8%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal  

adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (6) 

Does Clinical Pharmacology provide any contribution in optimal dosing conditions/therapeutic individualization? 

Review 

The results from the clinical pharmacology studies and two clinical studies (trials 3794 and 3957),  

support a recommended use for oral semaglutide tablet to be taken on an empty stomach and be  

swallowed whole with up to half a glass of water equivalent to 120 mL without splitting, crushing  

or chewing the tablet. After taking oral semaglutide, patients are recommended to wait at least 30  

minutes before the first meal or drink of the day and taking other oral medications (8,9,10,16) 

Semaglutide dosing should  

follow a titration scheme. Taking two 7 mg semaglutide tablets to achieve a 14 mg dose is not  

recommended. Patients treated with weekly 0.5 mg OZEMPIC (semaglutide) subcutaneous injection can  

be transitioned to 14 mg oral semaglutide by starting oral therapy 2 to -4 days following the last injection. There is no equivalent dose of oral semaglutide for 1 mg OZEMPIC  

injection (11,26) 

 

Label 

Instruct patients to take RYBELSUS at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or other oral  

medications of the day with no more than 4 ounces of plain water only  

Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking RYBELSUS with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other  

oral medications will lessen the effect of RYBELSUS by decreasing its absorption. Waiting more than 30  

minutes to eat may increase the absorption of RYBELSUS (1,3,11) 

Clinical pharmacology contribution in providing DDI/Drug-food interaction 

Review 

Effect of food on the PK of semaglutide was studied in a single-center, randomized, open-labeled,  

multiple-dose, parallel group study in healthy subjects (n=78). Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to three  

treatment arms (fed, fasting and reference). All subjects received 5 mg oral semaglutide for 5 days  

followed by 10 mg oral semaglutide for 5 days. Subjects in the fed group fasted for 10 hours overnight  

after which they received a high-fat, high-calorie meal followed by administration of semaglutide with  

240 mL of water and 4-hour post-dose fasting period. Subjects in the fasting group fasted 10-hour  

overnight followed by administration of semaglutide with 240 mL water and a 4-hour post-dose fasting  

period. In the reference group, subjects fasted 6-hour overnight followed by administration of  

semaglutide with 120 mL water and 30 min post-dose fasting. As a result of the low semaglutide exposure  

in the fed group, patients are advised to take oral semaglutide on an empty stomach (43) 

Semaglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of  

other oral medications. In DDI trials, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications to any  

clinically relevant degree. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required. When a single dose of levothyroxine 600 ug was concurrently  

administered with semaglutide, the total exposure (AUC) of thyroxine (adjusted for endogenous levels)  

was increased by 33%. (46,48,49). 

 

Label  

The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when RYBELSUS is used in combination with insulin secretagogues  

(e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of  

sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin  

RYBELSUS causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of other  

oral medications. Levothyroxine exposure was increased 33% (90% CI: 125-142) when administered with  

RYBELSUS in a drug interaction study.  

Consider increased clinical or laboratory monitoring for medications that have a narrow therapeutic  

index or that require clinical monitoring (8) 

The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered  

oral medicinal products. Trials were conducted to study the potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of  

oral medications taken with semaglutide administered orally at steady-state exposure.  

No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction with semaglutide (13)

Does clinical pharmacology provide any evidence of warnings/precautions? 

Review 

Oral semaglutide is not recommended as a first-line therapy for patients who have inadequate glycemic  

control on diet and exercise because of the uncertain relevance of rodent C-cell tumor findings to humans  

Oral semaglutide has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Other antidiabetic therapies  

should be considered in patients with a history of pancreatitis  

Oral semaglutide is not indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of  

patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings (30,31)

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the  

postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship  

between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans (1,4) 

The absolute risk  

increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy  

at baseline. Moreover, the effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been  

studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic  

retinopathy (5) 

Does clinical pharmacology provide evidence of drug use in specific population?  

Review 

No data available 

 

Label 

Available data with RYBELSUS use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk  

of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are clinical considerations  

regarding the risks of poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications.  (8,9) 

There are no data on the presence of semaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the  

effects on milk production. (9) 

Discontinue RYBELSUS in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout  

period for semaglutide (10)
