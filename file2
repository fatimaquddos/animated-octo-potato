Intrinsic factors examined 

 

 

Age (Adults/Paediatric) 

Review 

Age, sex, race, and ethnicity did not alter the PK of semaglutide (mention OZEMPIC)sufficiently to warrant a dose  

adjustment based on any of these factors. (14) 

Label 

Safety and efficacy of OZEMPIC have not been established in paediatric patients (younger than 18 years). (10,15) 

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but  

greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. (11) 

Gender (Male/Female) 

Review 

Age, sex, race, and ethnicity did not alter the PK of semaglutide sufficiently to warrant a dose  

adjustment based on any of these factors. (14) 

Label 

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, ethnicity, upper GI disease, and renal  

impairment do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide (14) 

Body weight/weight cutoffs if any 

Review 

A body weight reduction of ~4-5 kg was evident in patients with T2DM and in obese, non-diabetic subjects following 12 weeks of treatment with semaglutide. In obese, non-diabetic  

subjects the reduction in body weight was likely attributed to appetite and energy intake rather  

than due to energy expenditure. No dose adjustments are recommended based on this covariate, due to  

the nature of the dosing regimen, starting low and increasing dose based on glycemic response (14). 

Label 

The exposure of semaglutide decreases  

with an increase in body weight. However, semaglutide doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg provide adequate systemic  

exposure over the body weight range of 40-198 kg evaluated in the clinical trials (14)

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in various body weights/BMI? 

Review 

Population PK analysis  

which demonstrated that semaglutide exposure was inversely related to body weight (higher  

body weight resulted in lower exposure). Steady-state exposure of semaglutide (AUC0-168hr,SS and Cmax,SS) following 1 mg once weekly SC  

dosing appeared to be lower in patients with T2DM when compared to healthy subjects. The  

Applicant reports that these observations are likely due to patients with T2DM having a higher  

body weight when compared healthy subjects. (30) 

Overall the results indicate a lower appetite during both fasting and  

postprandial periods for subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo in a study to determine potential mechanisms by which semaglutide lowers body weight (50) 

Label 

The exposure of semaglutide decreases  

with an increase in body weight. However, semaglutide doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg provide adequate systemic  

exposure over the body weight range of 40-198 kg evaluated in the clinical trials (14) 

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation among different races? 

Review 

No difference in the PK of semaglutide was observed between the 2 subject  

populations (Caucasian and Japanese) in Geometric mean plasma concentration-time profiles of semaglutide at steady-state following  

administration of the last dose of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide in healthy Caucasian and  

Japanese subjects (24)

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in renal dysfunction? 

 

Review 

Study NN9535-3616, a multicenter, single-dose, parallel-group, open-label study, was conducted  

to investigate the PK of semaglutide in 5 groups of subjects with normal renal function, and  

mild, moderate, severe, and end-stage renal impairment and results suggested that Renal impairment does not impact the PK of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner and  

thereby dose adjustments of semaglutide are not needed in patients with T2DM with renal  

impairment (64) 

Label 

Renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a  

clinically relevant manner (15) 

Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal  

function and explain the associated signs and symptoms of renal impairment, as well as the possibility of  

dialysis as a medical intervention if renal failure occurs (22). 

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in hepatic dysfunction? 

Review 

Study NN9535-3651, a multicenter, single-dose, parallel-group, open-label study, was conducted  

to investigate the PK of semaglutide in 4 groups of subjects with normal hepatic function and 

mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment and the results indicated that hepatic impairment does not impact the exposure of semaglutide  

and thereby dose adjustments of semaglutide are not needed in patients with T2DM with hepatic  

impairment (64,67). 

Label 

The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic  

impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function in a study with a  

single-dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide. Hepatic impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a  

clinically relevant manner (15) 

Clinical Pharmacology contribution in dose modification/dose escalation in other body organs? 

Review 

The effect of OZEMPIC on cardiac repolarization was tested in  

a through QTc trial. At a dose 1.5 times the proposed maximum  

recommended dose, semaglutide does not prolong the QT interval to  

any clinically relevant extent (19) 

Study NN9535-3685 investigated the effect of 1 mg SC semaglutide or matching placebo at  

steady-state on the ad libitum energy intake in obese, non-diabetic subjects investigated the impact of this delay in gastric emptying on postprandial glucose concentrations  

following treatment with semaglutide. (47) 

Label 

Advise patients treated with OZEMPIC of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse  

reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. (22) 

Does Clinical Pharmacology provide any contribution in optimal dosing conditions/therapeutic individualization? 

Review 

The proposed  

dosing regimen for semaglutide is 0.25 mg once weekly via SC administration as a starting dose,  

after 4 weeks the dose should be increased to 0.5 mg once weekly. If further improvement in  

glycemic control is required, then after 4 weeks, the dose may be increased to 1 mg once weekly.  

The maximum recommended dose is 1 mg once weekly. 

No therapeutic individualization of semaglutide is recommended.(18)

Clinical pharmacology contribution in providing DDI/Drug-food interaction 

Review 

No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were observed between semaglutide and any of the  

evaluated co-administered drugs, therefore no dose adjustments are proposed when co-administered with semaglutide (15) 

Subsequent to meal consumption, semaglutide treatment induced lower insulin peak  

concentrations in patients with T2DM.(40) 

The effect  

of semaglutide treatment on insulin response was more pronounced in the fasting state; however  

for glucagon response the effect was evident in both the fasting and postprandial states. (43, 68) 

 

Label  

The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when Ozempic is used in combination with insulin secretagogues  

(e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of  

sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin (5,8)  

OZEMPIC causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of other  

oral medications. (9,13) 

 No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction with semaglutide was observed based on the evaluated  

medications; therefore, no dose adjustment is required when co-administered with semaglutide (15)

Review 

Recommended dosage (17) 

 

 

Label 

The maximum recommended dosage is 1 mg once weekly. The 0.25 mg dose is  

intended for treatment initiation and is not effective for glycemic control. (3) 

Clinical pharmacology information provides supportive evidence of  

effectiveness 

Review 

Given the need for different treatment goals (in HbA1c  

reduction) depending on disease severity, the availability of multiple dose levels that achieve  

exposures across the range of possible treatment effects is ideal. (53) 

The proposed dosing regimen is based on response to treatment and tolerability which  

inherently takes into account interpatient differences in PK/PD for efficacy and safety.  

Therefore dosing adjustments based on exposure alone may be unnecessary. (60) 

 

Label 

The efficacy of OZEMPIC was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg)  

at baseline, diabetes duration and level of renal function impairment. (16) 

Does clinical pharmacology provide any evidence of warnings/precautions? 

Review 

 

 

Label 

OZEMPIC is not recommended as a first-line therapy for patients who have inadequate glycemic control on  

diet and exercise because of the uncertain relevance of rodent C-cell tumor findings to humans. 

 OZEMPIC has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Consider other antidiabetic therapies  

in patients with a history of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions  

 OZEMPIC is not a substitute for insulin. OZEMPIC is not indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes  

mellitus or for the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these  

settings. (1,3) 

OZEMPIC is contraindicated in patients with:  

 A personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple  

Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 

 Known hypersensitivity to semaglutide or to any of the product components (4) 

Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic  

Retinopathy (5) 

Does clinical pharmacology provide evidence of drug use in specific population?  

Review 

Only renal and hepatic impairment mentioned (89,90) 

 

Label 

There are limited data with semaglutide use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse  

developmental outcomes. OZEMPIC should be used during pregnancy only if  

the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. (9) 

There are no data on the presence of semaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the  

effects on milk production.(10) 

Discontinue OZEMPIC in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period  

for semaglutide (10). 

Safety and efficacy of OZEMPIC have not been established in pediatric patients (younger than 18 years). (10)

Review 

Bioavailability: The population PK analysis suggested that BA decreased approximately 3% for injection into the  

thigh compared to the abdominal skin and that BA decreased approximately 8% for injection into  

the upper arm compared to in the abdominal skin. (15) 

No formal BE assessment  

was conducted with the to-be-marketed formulation (1.34 mg/mL); the Applicant reports that the  

results generated for product strengths 1 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL is representative of the to-bemarketed formulation of semaglutide (18)
